# Components

Bonaparte Components follow three main principles:

- Components create structure but are otherwise design agnostic.
- Components are _pure_. Functionality is controlled by custom attributes only.
- No use of the `class` attribute to create functionality.


There are currently two types of components:

## 1. Basic structural components
Basic Components provide simple structure and minimal functionality to be as versatile as possible.

## 2. Opinionated high level components
High level components are more opinionated in their functionality and are build for a certain use case.
