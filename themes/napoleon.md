#Napoleon Bonaparte Theme

Napoleon is a [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) inspired theme developed for editorial tools at Dow Jones.

Like common front end frameworks Napoleon provides a set of CSS classes to style HTML elements.

In addition to the traditional HTML elements, Napoleon also defines styles and classes for Bonaparte components.

## Example

[Kitchen Sink](http://bonaparte.github.io/theme-napoleon/examples/kitchen-sink.html)

## Main Features

### Baseline Grid

**All elements styled with Napoleon fall on a baseline grid.** This allows developers to mix and match Napoleon elements and still receive a clean user interface.

**The baseline grid is defined as `1rem`**. Napoleon defines `1rem` as `12px` by default.

### Namespaced

By default Napoleon doesn't apply any styles to html elements.

Resets and styling of base tags (`<p>`, `small`, `<h1>â€“<h6>`, etc) are only applied for elements within a `.napoleon` wrapper, or elements that have the `.ui` class.
