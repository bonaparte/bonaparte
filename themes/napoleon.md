#Napoleon Bonaparte Theme

Napoleon is a [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) inspired theme developed for editorial tools at Dow Jones.

Like common front end frameworks Napoleon provides a set of CSS classes to style HTML elements.

In addition to the traditional HTML elements, Napoleon also defines styles and classes for Bonaparte components.

## Examples
* [Kitchen Sink](http://bonaparte.github.io/theme-napoleon/examples/kitchen-sink.html)
* [Starter App](http://bonaparte.github.io/starter-vanilla/)

## Main Features

#### Baseline Grid

All elements and text styled with Napoleon align on a baseline grid. This allows Napoleon elements to be mixed and matched while still resulting in a clean user interface.

The baseline grid is defined as `1rem`. Napoleon defines `1rem` as `12px` by default.

> Toggle the grid in the top left corner in the [kitchen sink](http://bonaparte.github.io/theme-napoleon/examples/kitchen-sink.html).

#### Namespaced

Napoleon doesn't apply any styles to any HTML elements by default.

Resets and styling of base tags (`<p>`, `small`, `<h1>â€“<h6>`) are applied for elements within a `.napoleon` wrapper, or elements that have the `.ui` class.

Through this, Napoleon doesn't interfere with other CSS on a page.
