# Themes

Bonaparte Components don't come with any design by default. Themes can be used to provide a set of styles and classes that work well with Bonaparte.

>A theme is purely for visual styling and does not provide functionality. It's optional and not required for Bonaparte Components to work.


### Currently available Themes:

- [Napoleon](napoleon.html)
