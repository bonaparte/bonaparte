# Bonaparte 

Bonaparte is a modular UX Frontend Framework. It is created at to help developers at Dow Jones & Co. create better editorial tools.

While creating Bonaparte we follow the following two goals:

#### Bonaparte works together with:
- __Any JavaScript Framework like React, Angular or plain jQuery__<br> Bonaparte is written in plain JavaScript and uses WebComponents to create functionality. WebComponents allow functionality to live in HTML. This allows Bonaparte components to work with any Framework in  any programming language that outputs HTML.
- __Any Frontend Framework like Bootstrap, Foundation or Semantic UI__ <br> Bonaparte is Design agnostic. It's components provide structure but do not come with any design. In addition, no component uses the `class` attribute to create functionality. Therefore, the CSS classes of any Frontend Framework can be used to add styling.
