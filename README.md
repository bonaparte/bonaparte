# examples-bonaparte

These examples are still work in progress and will be used to create fuctional tests that covers all functionality within the examples.

Example snipits and tests will live in the compoent repository.

```npm install``` Will set up the environment.

```npm run build``` pull all the example pages, tests files (once complete) and run our test page.

My hope is that we can then have status showing if each component has passed its test to our (yet to be) predefined test criteria
