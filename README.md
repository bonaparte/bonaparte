# Bonaparte 


Bonaparte is a modular UX front-end framework created at Dow Jones.

### Background
Bonaparte was created to help developers in a large international company like Dow Jones to create consistent user experiences.

At Dow Jones, editorial tools are in constant development. These web based tools are written in different programming languages by many people around the world. 
Bonaparte is part of an ongoing initiative to streamline the editorial work flow and create a consistent user experience for our editorial staff.

#### Bonaparte works together with:
- __Any JavaScript Framework like React, Angular or plain jQuery__<br> Bonaparte is written in plain JavaScript and uses WebComponents to create functionality. WebComponents allow functionality to live in HTML. This allows Bonaparte components to work with any Framework in  any programming language that outputs HTML.
- __Any Frontend Framework like Bootstrap, Foundation or Semantic UI__ <br> Bonaparte is Design agnostic. It's components provide structure but do not come with any design. In addition, no component uses the `class` attribute to create functionality. Therefore, the CSS classes of any Frontend Framework can be used to add styling.
