# tests-bonaparte

This reop will run the bonaparte fictional tests. 

```npm install``` Will set up the environment.

```npm run build``` pull all the example pages, tests files (once complete) and run our test page.

My hope is that we can then have status page showing if each component has passed its test to our (yet to be) predefined criteria
