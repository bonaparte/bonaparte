# Bonaparte *(Alpha)*

Bonaparte is a modular UX framework designed to work with standard UI frameworks.
It provides a set of commonly used structural components that help designers and developers to create better user experiences.

Components are written in plain JavaScript and work nicely with frameworks like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) or just [jQuery](http://jquery.com). WebComponents allow functionality to live in HTML. This makes Bonaparte compatible with any framework or programming language that outputs HTML.

Bonaparte is design agnostic. It's components provide structure but do not come with any design. No component uses the `class` attribute to create functionality. Therefore CSS classes of any front end framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) or [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) can be used for styling.


#### Using Bonaparte is as easy as using HTML:
```
<bonaparte-scroll>
    <div>
    
        <!-- Scrolling Content -->
    
    </div>
</bonaparte-scroll>
```
