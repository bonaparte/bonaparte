This build uses a custom theme inspired by Semantic UI which has been developed for editorial tools at Dow Jones & Co.

Bonaparte is a modular UX front-end framework created at Dow Jones & Co.


## Bonaparte works with:
- __Any JavaScript Framework like React, Angular or plain jQuery__<br> Bonaparte is written in plain JavaScript and uses WebComponents to create functionality. WebComponents allow functionality to live in HTML. This allows Bonaparte components to work with any Framework in  any programming language that outputs HTML.
- __Any Frontend Framework like Bootstrap, Foundation or Semantic UI__ <br> Bonaparte is Design agnostic. It's components provide structure but do not come with any design. In addition, no component uses the `class` attribute to create functionality. Therefore, the CSS classes of any Frontend Framework can be used to add styling.
