# Getting Started

The easiest way to get your hands dirty is to start with one of the three starter kits:

* [Starter Vanilla](http://github.com/bonaparte/starter-vanilla)<br>*Creates a basic page using Bonaparte components without any framework.*
* [Starter React](http://github.com/bonaparte/starter-react)<br>*Creates a basic page using Bonaparte components and the React framework.*
* [Starter Angular](http://github.com/bonaparte/starter-angular)<br>*Creates a basic page using Bonaparte components and the Angular framework.*

Each starter includes the all Bonaparte components and the Napoleon theme (Napoleon Build).
Just select your favorite framework and open `index.html` in your browser!
